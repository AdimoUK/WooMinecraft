WooMinecraft
============

Note From TekkitCommando
------------

I will have releases of new updates on Github Here, and by my rights with the GPU v2 which is what this software is licensed under I am allowed to do that, I have big plans for this project and hope that @JayWood likes the changes and additions I make. I will probably not post a download for the updates anywhere else until I have permission from @JayWood, but that doesn't mean you can upload my updates anywhere else and take credit for it (Please don't do it), I have message JayWood via Skype and hope to have permission to update the software (and upload the jar freely) :) It has been a year or so since the last updates :(

A WooCommerce Minecraft Bridge
------------

This bridge was created out of both a necessity and a side-project of mine.  I, like other people, wanted a free and open sourced self-hosted solution for Minecraft donations.

Leveraging the power of a WordPress plugin, WooCommerce, and Bukkit's API, this amazing plugin was made.  Unfortunately though I was unable to get the pom.xml setup with Eclipse, maybe someone would be willing enough to make a pull request to the development branch, hint hint...

Please Contribute
-------------

I encourage all of you to fork the repo and make pull requests to the development branch.  I would like this to become the best open source project minecraft donation system out there.  

To be clear, my Java is not what it should be, I'm sure there are others out there who have better ways of doing what is intended.  Not to mention that there are other fellow WordPress geeks who have awesome ideas as well.  Let's make this the best plugin ever, I believe we can do it.

> All users who make a pull request will receive credit either on this README, or in the future wiki.  Which I'm working on almost weekly.

> Additionally there will be a CONRIBUTORS file which lists each and every contributor along with a url if they wish.  Simply add this in your pull request and it's done.
