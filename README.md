A WooCommerce Minecraft Bridge
------------

This bridge was created out of both a necessity and a side-project of mine.  I, like other people, wanted a free and open sourced self-hosted solution for Minecraft donations.

Leveraging the power of a WordPress plugin, WooCommerce, and Bukkit's API, this amazing plugin was made.  Unfortunately though I was unable to get the pom.xml setup with Eclipse, maybe someone would be willing enough to make a pull request to the development branch, hint hint...

> I will not be providing mirrors, only official releases will be here for now.  Do not download an imitation anywhere else, you'v been warned.

Please Contribute
-------------

I encourage all of you to fork the repo and make pull requests to the development branch.  I would like this to become the best open source project minecraft donation system out there.

> All users who make a pull request will receive credit either on this landing page, or in the future wiki.  Which I'm working on almost weekly.
